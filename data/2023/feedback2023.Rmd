## Feedback from virtual participants

### What was the primary reason you did not attend on site?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
library(arsenal)
tab1 <- tableby(background ~ reason, data = parti, subset = (mode == "...exclusively virtually"), total = FALSE, test = FALSE)
summary(tab1)
```

### What would have made you attend on site?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- select(filter(parti, mode == "...exclusively virtually"), made)
t1 <- as.data.frame(t1[is.na(t1) == FALSE])
names(t1) <- "What would have made you attend on site?"
kable(t1)
```

## What did you most like about the workshop?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- select(filter(parti, is.na(like) == FALSE), like)
names(t1) <- "What did you most like about the workshop?"
kable(t1)
```

## What did you most dislike about the workshop?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- select(filter(parti, is.na(dislike) == FALSE), dislike)
names(t1) <- "What did you most dislike about the workshop?"
kable(t1)
```

## What would be the most important topic you would you like to see discussed next year?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- select(filter(parti, is.na(important) == FALSE), important)
names(t1) <- "What would be the most important topic you would you like to see discussed next year?"
kable(t1)
```

## Additional feedback

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- select(filter(parti, is.na(add) == FALSE), add)
names(t1) <- "Additional feedback"
kable(t1)
```

# Feedback from contributors

In total, `r nrow(contr)` contributors (presenters, chairs, short topic presenters, poster presenters, chat observers) have completed the feedback form until the above cutoff date.

Contributors were invited to optionally give their name. Some did - reach out to me if you are interested.

## Where can we improve next year?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- select(filter(contr, is.na(improve) == FALSE), improve)
names(t1) <- "Where can we improve next year?"
kable(t1)
```

## What should stay?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- select(filter(contr, is.na(stay) == FALSE), stay)
names(t1) <- "What should stay?"
kable(t1)
```
