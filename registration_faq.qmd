# What block booking options are available for companies?

## Face-to-face block booking

We have updated our block bocking offerings compared to previous years:

- Block booking for face-to-face attendance: 
  - 8500 Euro up to 50 participants per company. 
  - 10500 Euro for 51 to 70 participants.  
  - 12500 Euro for 71 to 90 participants. 
  - Beyond 91 face-to-face participants per company we charge 12500 + 120 Euro per each additional participant. 

For all face-to-face block bookings an arbitrary number of virtual attendees is included as well.

## Virtual block-booking

- Block booking for virtual attendance: 2800 Euro, i.e. you reach break-even with this option if at least 40 colleagues from your company register for virtual attendance to the workshop.
- `r colFmt("The conference organizers reserve the right to cap the number of registered face-to-face attendees for a company with block booking, in order to keep catering costs under control. This never happened so far though.")`

Please reach out to [Egbert Biesheuvel](mailto:egbert.biesheuvel@viatris.com) if your company is interested in one of these options.
