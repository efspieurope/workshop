# What's in stock for the 2025 workshop?

<!-- - Not new is that we keep the **`r colFmt("registration fees at the same decent level")`**. This eventhough we extend the workshop by half a day, see next item. -->
This will be the 10th anniversary workshop. The local organizing committee is already working hard to make this yet another special event - stay tuned!

# Date and venue of 2025 workshop

The workshop will take place 10-12th September 2025 again at [Biozentrum](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/) in beautiful [Basel](https://www.basel.com/en).
