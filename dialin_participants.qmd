# Introduction

You have registered for the EFSPI regulatory statistics workshop. This document provides necessary information for virtual participants to dial in to the zoom meetings at the day of the event. For any further questions please do not hesitate to reach out to one of the [local organizing committee members](local.html).

# Zoom instructions

- Status of registrations: Find this [here](https://efspieurope.github.io/workshop/data/2024/analysis2024.html). We have `r nrow(reg2)` registrations from `r length(unique(reg2$country2))` countries as of now, with `r table(reg2$mode)[1]` face-to-face. `r sum(dat)` colleagues from regulatory agencies registered so far.

# Face-to-face attendance

- **WLAN in the Biozentrum**: Connect to Unibas visitor. It will ask for your mobile phone number for confirmation.
- Upon arrival we ask you to register at the conference desk and to pick up your badge.

# Posting of slides and recordings

As soon as we get approval from speakers links to slidedecks and recordings will be posted [here](past.html). This may take a few days or even weeks, depending on the responsiveness of contributors. `r colFmt("Please do not send emails to us asking about postings. They will happen for those contributors who agree.")`
