  - 10500 Euro for 51 to 70 participants.  
  - 12500 Euro for 71 to 90 participants. 
  - Beyond 91 face-to-face participants per company we charge 12500 + 120 Euro per each additional participant. 

For all face-to-face block bookings unlimited virtual attendees are included as well.

`r colFmt("The conference organizers reserve the right to cap the number of registered face-to-face attendees for a company with block booking, in order to keep catering costs under control. This never happened so far though.")`

## Virtual block-booking

- Block booking for virtual attendance: 2800 Euro, i.e. you reach break-even with this option if at least 40 colleagues from your company register for virtual attendance to the workshop.
