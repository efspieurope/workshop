# What's new for the 2024 workshop?

- Not new is that we keep the **`r colFmt("registration fees at the same decent level")`**. This eventhough we extend the workshop by half a day, see next item.
- We will have a dedicated HTA session on the Friday morning, see [draft program](https://efspieurope.github.io/workshop/data/2024/9th%20EFSPI%20RegStat%20Workshop%20program.pdf). 
- For the first time we will have a patient talking.

# Date and venue of 2024 workshop

The workshop will take place 11-13th September 2024 (start morning of 11th and end noon of 13th) again at [Biozentrum](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/) in beautiful [Basel](https://www.basel.com/en).
