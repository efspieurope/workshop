I got some feedback from an online attendant thought that sometimes the session was started a bit too late, resulting in them missing the beginning of the session. The balance between talks and time for discussion was also nice. I also liked the topic on how to ask for scientific advice, I think it can be nice to keep one session on such a more communication related topic (I think a topic on how to communicate about estimands to clinicians/non-statisticians can also be helpful for next time, this seems to still be a difficult problem). |\n|Short topic session should  stay also next year, the length of the sessions was perfect and also the time assigned to the discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|Opportunity to plan session jointly between regulatory and industry chair                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|Allow ample time for informal discussion (coffee and lunch breaks).

I got some feedback from an online attendant thought that sometimes the session was started a bit too late, resulting in them missing the beginning of the session. The balance between talks and time for discussion was also nice. I also liked the topic on how to ask for scientific advice, I think it can be nice to keep one session on such a more communication related topic (I think a topic on how to communicate about estimands to clinicians/non-statisticians can also be helpful for next time, this seems to still be a difficult problem). |\n|Short topic session should  stay also next year, the length of the sessions was perfect and also the time assigned to the discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|Opportunity to plan session jointly between regulatory and industry chair                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|Allow ample time for informal discussion (coffee and lunch breaks).

The EMA-SA session was also great, maybe something similar could also been done in the other direction - i.e. so regulators can get a better understanding how industry works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n:::",
