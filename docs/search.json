In order to have a focused and fit-for-purpose program talks are by invitation only. There is no option to submit talks for presentation in one of the sessions.\nWonder how you can get involved with the scientific committee? See here.\n\n\nShort topics\nThe short topics session is a hallmark of each year’s workshop. Anyone can submit proposals for discussion until 15th August to Helle Lynggaard. Accepted proposals can be presented in five minutes using two slides to the audience, with the intention to ask one or more clear questions to a panel of regulators. They will then comment on these questions. For past topics that were discussed in this session see here.\n\n\nPosters\nThe primary purpose of the poster session is to give EFSPI / PSI eSIGs the opportunity to present their progress. As for talks, there is no option to submit posters other than from said eSIGs.\n\n\nQuestions?\nFor feedback and questions send an email to info@efspiworkshop.org."

    "text": "EFSPI regulatory statistics workshop\nEach year, a small team of volunteers organizes the EFSPI Regulatory Statistics Workshop on behalf of EFSPI. The goal of the workshop is to bring together statisticians and partner functions from pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies, and academia to discuss topics of common interest.\nThe unique feature of the workshop is an atmosphere of collaboration and open discussion of statistical and regulatory science in general. Over the years the workshop has sharpened its profile and with regular participation of speakers from regulatory agencies such as EMA, many European regulatory agencies, FDA, PMDA, MHRA, and many more has become a voice in the global dialogue on regulatory statistics. Furthermore, with HTA considerations becoming ever more important in Europe and beyond topics pertinent to HTA are also increasingly discussed.\nSince its inception in 2016 the workshop has always taken place in Basel, Switzerland. Details about the 2024 issue are available here.\n\n\nParallel workshop in the US\nThe ASA Biopharmaceutical Section Regulatory-Industry Statistics Workshop is organized by the ASA and FDA and takes place from 27.-29. September 2024 in Rockville, MD.\nBoth these workshops aspire to build a statistical community across regulatory agencies and industry. Both events provide a forum to discuss topics of common interest for industry and regulators and offer many opportunities for everyone to participate in these discussions and impact alignment.\nASA workshop\nRegistration\n\n\nWhat you find here\nOn this webpage you find links and materials for the yearly EFSPI regulatory statistics workshop in Basel.\nThe workshop is organized by EFSPI.\nFor feedback and questions send an email to info@efspiworkshop.org."

It was a great way to get to that special atmosphere.\n\n\nThe choice of topics\n\n\ndiverse and relevant selection of topics\n\n\nDiscussions and exchange of the ideas\n\n\ncases discussion with regulatory people\n\n\nThe open discussion between industry and Health Authority attendees\n\n\nParticipation, good invollvment of attendance\n\n\nVery relevant topics without technical details\n\n\nPractical advice, concrete tipps how to handle certain situations\n\n\nScientific and regulatory content\n\n\nAbility to directly ask questions to regulators\n\n\nThe interaction/dialogue.

I would also welcome more time for discussions/debates\n\n\nTravelling in the morning of the first day was not an option. Furthermore, the possibility for a joint dinner on day 1.\n\n\nI payed more than 50 EUR in bank transfer ☹️. Would be much easier with 💳\n\n\nNothing\n\n\nSometimes the talks were quite high level or procedural\n\n\nNA\n\n\nSome sessions are at late night time for me\n\n\nUnfortunately the information of the program reached me at a time whne other meetings had been agreed, so I could not attend the entire program.\n\n\nThose sits were very uncomfortable\n\n\nnothing relevant\n\n\nnothing\n\n\n/\n\n\nI think the lunch break on the first day could have been shortened as they were only a handful of posters and the authors were not stood next to them to discuss.\n\n\nNA\n\n\nparticipation of online attendees was challenging some timess\n\n\n-\n\n\nThe lunch time was a bit too long.\n\n\nspeakers presenting virtually\n\n\n-\n\n\nThat it was not allowed to take something to drink/a glass with me during the session. Better to have PET bottles. Or what about a “refill station” where you can fill your bottle with water again, to avoid too much plastic.\n\n\nall good, at the beginning of some sessions the mic was mutes but that was quickly solved\n\n\nSound quality\n\n\nNothing\n\n\nNothing negative to comment really\n\n\nNot all topics were of equal interest to me.\n\n\nWarm food for lunch would have been a nice option\n\n\nsome presentations could have been shorter\n\n\nNo comment - all very good!\n\n\nWine Testing\n\n\nOccasionally sound issues for virtual attendees\n\n\nVirtual presentations. Sometimes could not hear well because of the microphones\n\n\nSome lectures appeared a bit unfocused and thus not useful.\n\n\nLocation - I am not a great fan of Basel.\n\n\nNo complaints!\n\n\nnothing\n\n\ntalks about updated guidance\n\n\nLunch options could be more varied\n\n\nInsufficient drinks on first day\n\n\nnone\n\n\nNothing. Only minor thing was that several times the questions from the auditorium was not heard online, and the speaker did not repeat before answering\n\n\nthe chaires!!!\n\n\nConsider to only have panel discussions at the end rather to allow questions in between. That wasn’t really helpful. Try to avoid as much as possible to have virtual speakers as on-site attendence improves the interaction.\n\n\nSome of the online presenters from US were not easy to understand\n\n\nnothing\n\n\nNo bottle water the first day.\n\n\nNothing.\n\n\nSeats too hard for 2 hours sitting\n\n\nI missed the main message from some of the presentations\n\n\nThe sandwiches served at lunch were pretty dry. Apart from that the meeting could have been longer than only 2 days :-)\n\n\nWould be great to have more clinical representation both from the regulatory side and industry side. Was the gender imbalance on the panel in the short topic session representative of the proportion at the HAs? How often does Novartis want to present the NEOS study at the EFSPI workshop? If the response is “it depends” to half the questions, maybe the presenters should be encouraged to be more precise in their questions. I would love to see more case studies from the regulatory side, in particular what motivates their questions/feedback.\n\n\nearly start time for U.S. participants\n\n\nThere was nothing to dislike\n\n\nNot really applicable as I only followed a very small amount of sessions.\n\n\nNothing I can think of.\n\n\nthe dares (had Day 2 conflict )- unfortunate\n\n\ntechnical glitches\n\n\nlong winded talks\n\n\nI did not realize that the course would be like that, so my problem: I thought it would be more about statistics since I am a clinician without huge statistical background.\n\n\nthe topics on platform trial was not well informative, FDA presentation of new guidance\n\n\nVirtual presenters. Presenters should be on site, to allow possibility to discuss with then e.g. during the breaks.\n\n\nFood\n\n\nnothing\n\n\nImportant regulatory and scietific topics about Platform trials were not really covered in the talk\n\n\nQuality of presentations: Most speakers had overloaded slides and did not allign orally presented contents with the presentation of slides.\n\n\nnothnig\n\n\nNothing\n\n\nNothing\n\n\nNot being there. For virtual participants, it would have been great to see the person asking a question\n\n\nSome speakers I couldn’t hear well. Ask virtual speakers to use head-set may help and show in person speakers how to use the microphone.\n\n\nIf the slide can be uploaded before meeting\n\n\nTalk on platform trials\n\n\nNone. All where intersting to me.\n\n\nLunch break was very long, I’d rather have an additional short coffee break than 2-hour lunch\n\n\n-\n\n\nSome sessions were a little longer than ideal, but overall it’s difficult to find anything substantive to dislike.\n\n\nI found the 1st day of the workshop less engaging. Although the topics were relevant, they did not keep my attention and I found it hard to keep engaged\n\n\nToo much emphasis on hypothetical scenarios, guidelines and frameworks- I would like to see more of practical examples, ways of working to learn more about how the impact of these frameworks etc. are having for patient access to medicines\n\n\nIt was unfortunate that there was only one woman in the panel discussions, when there are plenty of qualified and successful women who could have participated.\n\n\nSome talks were too long or philisophical; very structural or operational aspects of regulatory organizations are interesting but not the real focus\n\n\nsometimes it was too high level: on the Thursday morning session\n\n\nTime zone\n\n\nNothing\n\n\nnothing as such\n\n\nMaybe an introduction was missing\n\n\nvirtual talks: I think those should be done in online workshop. I don’t see why we should all meet in a cinema like setting and listen to virtual talks. I think that is also very exhausting to listen to.\n\n\nlogistical glitches (sound off sometimes)\n\n\nNot applicable\n\n\nNot seeing the audience at the beginning\n\n\nNone\n\n\nFood…\n\n\nSometimes difficult to hear the questions from the audience\n\n\nThat it is always is in Basel. Can it be somewhere else sometimes?\n\n\nOn-line speakers where not always clearly audible\n\n\nI did not dislike anything about the workshop\n\n\ni do not have any dislikes; one aspect of atteention maybe would be to not have the regulators give too much time to explain general procedural issues. that is taking too much time and limits the time to really discuss about experiences about procedures, which is of most interest to all in the room and online.\n\n\nThe way of payement is complicated in my company. They need a formal invoice\n\n\nNone\n\n\nIf possible, adjusting the start time of the coference so that other time zones can join.\n\n\nnone\n\n\nSome of the topics were covered only superficially (for example the one on complex trials)\n\n\nFirst break for lunch on the first day a bit too long\n\n\nThe technical difficulties, especially in getting the sound work online\n\n\nLenghty answers without message\n\n\nnothing\n\n\nHaving HTA and regulatory together did not work so well, possibly having a separate session on HTA would be an alternative?\n\n\nNA\n\n\nThe chairs can be a bit painful to sit on for a long time\n\n\nNA\n\n\nThough drug companies are involved, maybe we shouldn’t do alcohol-based evening events\n\n\nSlightly too packed for 2 days. Suggestion to take place over 3 or 4 days.\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nChairs had a good gender balance, presenters were still mostly male and seldom young\n\n\nnothing\n\n\nno\n\n\nTiming of lunch break too late\n\n\nnone\n\n\nI feel there can be more of basic level discussions on interpretation of regulatory decision making from a statistical standpoint\n\n\nsound qulaity of some virtual speakers (use head sets?)\n\n\nSome of the presenters were unprepared or just bad.

They leave little room for engagement.\n\n\nIt was a great workshop. Perhaps having a panel from industry so we can learn more from each other.\n\n\nMaybe asking the virtual audience to upvote the questions submitted in the Q&A - it would make it easier for the chat observer to select which questions to ask when there is limited time.\n\n\nDifficult to say - everything worked really well in my opinion\n\n\nSome of the sessions, (e.g. Day 2 Session 5 that I was chairing) had short discussion time at the end and before this 4 talks, whereas some others, e.g. the one before had much more time assigned to it overall while it also included one less talk. Hence, more balance across the sessions would help.\n\n\nPerhaps share the workload among more members of the SC?\n\n\nSound quality was not optimal in front - sometimes difficult to understand the questions from the audience, difficult to understand the virtual panelists\n\n\nGiven the end-stage hiccough around sharing the recording, it would be good to have a more robust discussion with regulators up front to ensure that they feel comfortable enough with their disclosures to allow for continuous learning via sharing of the sessions. This is not something the organizers botched (every other year seems to have been shared), but as there were many new speakers this year just good to watch out for.\n\n\npreparatory meeting for key sessions organized by the chairs could be useful and improve session flow. I would limit remote presentations to minimum (maybe 1 FDA presentation). some of the remote presentations were great but this is a workshop and not a conference. so need to select topics such that we have on-site speakers\n\n\nI think that the short topics session could be advertised more to allow more people to send in a proposal. Many people were not aware of the possibility to propose a short topic, nor of the nature of the session (basically that one can pose a question to a panel of regulators). I could feel that people would have liked to submit a topic if they had known about this opportunity.\n\n\nIntroduce more case study from industry with learnings from regulatory interactions (similar to the Novartis case study)\n\n\nSome more clarity on expectations from Scientific Committee participants and short topic selection criteria\n\n\nMaybe one could group the HTA relevant sessions together. More specifically, the very first session featured David McConnell (Irish HTAB) and the very last session featured Stefan Lange (GER HTAB). I think more of my colleagues might have attended e.g. 1/2 day had these two talks been grouped more closely.\n\n\nSome of the virtual speakers were hard to understand because of the sound quality: use headphones?\n\n\nNothing comes to mind. It was a really well organized workshop."

Sessions like the SAT session where the regulatory and HTA topic was explicitly contrasted.\n\n\nShort topics on day 1\n\n\nRegulatory and HTA updates as well as short topics.\n\n\nThe time schedule. I have really appreciated the long breaks and time for discussions – between and also within the sessions after the presentations.\n\n\nSee above - keep it up (-:\n\n\nThe short topics early on Day 1 were very good. Also I liked that we had sufficient time for discussions in most sessions. That was very good as well.\n\n\nI personally really enjoyed the live interactions between Industry and regulators during the short topics session. I received similar feedback from participants attending.\n\n\nThe short topics session was brilliant. I liked the diversity of representatives from regulatory agencies that you were able to host. Compared to previous years (where often only 1-2 “voices” from regulators were heard), this was a very balanced and diverse group.\n\n\nThe more prominent place for the short topic session. More topics that are of interest for a larger audience rather than very specific topics that are only relevant in some indications.\n\n\nShort topic session early in the meeting, long discussions and breaks\n\n\nI enjoy this conference the last 3 years. I appreciate it’s evolution and the energy and interaction is always amazing.\n\n\nrelaxed atmosphere\n\n\nIt was nice to have the hybrid option (online and in person attendance). I got some feedback from an online attendant thought that sometimes the session was started a bit too late, resulting in them missing the beginning of the session. The balance between talks and time for discussion was also nice. I also liked the topic on how to ask for scientific advice, I think it can be nice to keep one session on such a more communication related topic (I think a topic on how to communicate about estimands to clinicians/non-statisticians can also be helpful for next time, this seems to still be a difficult problem).\n\n\nShort topic session should stay also next year, the length of the sessions was perfect and also the time assigned to the discussion\n\n\nOpportunity to plan session jointly between regulatory and industry chair\n\n\nAllow ample time for informal discussion (coffee and lunch breaks). Collaborative and scientific spirit!\n\n\nThe Short Topic Session\n\n\nThe hot topics session was again one of the highlights. The EMA-SA session was also great, maybe something similar could also been done in the other direction - i.e. so regulators can get a better understanding how industry works."
