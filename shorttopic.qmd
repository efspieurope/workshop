# Format of the short topic session

To guarantee the success of the session we would like to re-iterate the format:

- We have six topics distributed over two hours, which leaves each topic with 20min total time.
- You can present for five minutes using maximum two slides.
- `r colFmt("Presentation must be in person. There will be no virtual presentations in this session.")`
- Please make sure your presentation of the issue is generic enough so that everyone in the room can follow.
- Please ask one or more very explicit questions to the panel of regulators.
- Do not ask regulators for “recipes” in the sense of “if we do that then you guarantee to do that”.
- When formulating your questions ask yourself: “What would I answer if I were a regulator?” This may help to be precise and specific.
